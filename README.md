<sup>1</sup> The bounding boxes in LLaVA-v1.5 are based on the padded image. You can find the discussion [here](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/issues/606).

<sup>2</sup> The number of images are counted based on image IDs.
There might be duplicate images across different image sources.

We use different strategies to collect the prompts for different tasks.
- **Image captioning.** We carefully collect 5 manually written instructions and randomly sample one as the prompt for each caption. The fourth and fifth instructions are from [InstructBLIP](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS/blob/main/projects/instructblip/README.md).
- **Open-ended VQA.** As the answers in VQA datasets are generally short, we add an instruction after the question to ask the model to provide answers with a short sentence or phrase.
- **Multiple-choice VQA.** For A-OKVQA, we add an instruction before the question to ask the model to provide answers with correct options. For ScienceQA, we use the instructions and templates designed by [M3IT](https://m3-it.github.io/) and randomly sample one to format the prompt. Only data with image context are involved.
- **Grounding.** For RefCOCO/RefCOCO+/RefCOCOg, we use the data and templates in [Shikra](https://github.com/shikras/shikra) and randomly sample one to format the prompt.
- **GPT-4/GPT-4V generated & mixed datasets.** We keep the prompts unchanged.

## Quickstart

For the images, you can download the images from our [HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/DataOptim/tree/main/images) or the original websites.
If you already have the images, you can skip this process as the image IDs and file names are not changed.

Then unzip and organize the images in following structure.

```
|- images

  |- coco_2017

  |- web-celebrity

    |- images
  |- wikiart
    |- images
```

After that, you can use this diretory as the `--image_folder` in LLaVA's training script.

For the visual instruction tuning QAs, all of the data mentioned above are already converted to the training format of LLaVA in our HuggingFace repository.
You can download them directly from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/DataOptim/tree/main/data).

For referring QAs, the bounding box is in the form of [x1, y1, x2, y2], corresponding to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x and bottom right y. The values are float numbers normalized to [0, 1], based on the size of **original images**, except LLaVA-v1.5, which is based on the **padded image** (see more discussion [here](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/issues/606)). We provide a script [here](./tools/expand_to_square.py) to expand the bounding boxes to square.
